      <h2>About Nature</h2>
      <p>
        Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe.
        "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to
        life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part
        of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often
        understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.The word
        nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the
        Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in
        ancient times, literally meant "birth". In ancient philosophy, natura is
        mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis,
        which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants,
        animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own
        accord.The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one
        of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core
        applications of the word by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this
        word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has
        steadily gained currency ever since.

      <h2>About Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features
        are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the Solar
        System, it is third closest to the Sun; it is the largest terrestrial
        planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic
        features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow
        temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.
        Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water
        per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is
        covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and
        islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.
        Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have
        left traces of the original conditions. The outer surface is divided
        into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains
        active, with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core
        that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid
        inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core
        generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn,
        generate the geomagnetic field.

      <h2>Historical Perspective</h2>
      <p>
        Earth is estimated to have formed 4.54 billion years ago from the solar
        nebula, along with the Sun and other planets.The Moon formed
        roughly 20 million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the
        Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic
        activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor,
        most or all of which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the
        oceans and other water sources.The highly energetic chemistry is
        believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion
        years ago.Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface
        of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally
        combining to make a supercontinent. Roughly 750 million years ago, the
        earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The
        continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540
        million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180
        million years ago.During the Neoproterozoic era, freezing
        temperatures covered much of the Earth in glaciers and ice sheets. This
        hypothesis has been termed the "Snowball Earth", and it is of particular
        interest as it precedes the Cambrian explosion in which multicellular
        life forms began to proliferate about 530-540 million years ago.
